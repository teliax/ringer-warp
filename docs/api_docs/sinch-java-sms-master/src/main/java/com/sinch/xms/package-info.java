/**
 * This package contains a Java interface for the Sinch XMS API. This API is intended for managing
 * and sending batches of SMS and MMS messages as well as receiving mobile originated messages.
 *
 * <p>The typical use case of this library is to create a long lived {@link
 * com.sinch.xms.ApiConnection} object which is then used to submit batches and perform other
 * interaction with the XMS endpoint.
 *
 * <p>As a simple initial example we can consider a program that, when run, sends a single SMS and
 * exits.
 *
 * <pre>
 * import com.sinch.xms.ApiConnection;
 * import com.sinch.xms.SinchSMSApi;
 * import com.sinch.xms.api.MtBatchTextSmsResult;
 *
 * public class Example {
 *
 *     public static void main(String[] args) {
 *         ApiConnection conn = ApiConnection.builder()
 *                 .servicePlanId("my spid")
 *                 .token("my token")
 *                 .start();
 *
 *         try {
 *             MtBatchTextSmsResult result =
 *                     conn.createBatch(SinchSMSApi.batchTextSms()
 *                             .sender("my short code")
 *                             .addRecipient("my destination")
 *                             .body("my message")
 *                             .build());
 *
 *             System.out.println("The batch ID is " + result.id());
 *         } catch (Exception e) {
 *             System.err.println("Failed to send message: " + e.getMessage());
 *         }
 *     }
